# Barracuda NextGen Firewall F Series for Azure - High Availability Cluster with Cloud integration

![Build status](https://img.shields.io/vso/build/cudajvhoof/19118fdb-7d82-4c41-a1fd-b16e490dc968/9.svg) 

## Introduction
This Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template will deploy a cluster of Barracuda Next Gen Firewall F Series virtual machines in a new VNET. Deployment is done in a one-armed fashion where north-south, east-west and VPN tunnel traffic can be intercepted and inspected based on the User Defined Routing that is attached to the subnets that need this control. Additionally this template will deploy a Azure Load Balancer with an external IP to direct the traffic to the active unit in the cluster. Do not apply any UDR to the subnet where the NGF is located that points back to the NGF. This will cause routing loops.

To adapt this deployment to your requirements you can modify the azuredeploy.paramters.json file and/or the deployment script in Powershell or Azure CLI (Bash).

## Prerequisites
The solution does a check of the template when you use the provided scripts. It does require that [Programmatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/) is enabled for the Barracuda Next Gen Firewall F BYOL or PAYG images. Barracuda recommends use of **D**, **D_v2**, **F** or newer series. 

## Deployment

The package provides a deploy.ps1 and deploy.sh for Powershell or Azure CLI based deployments. This can be peformed from the Azure Portal as well as the any system that has either of these scripting infrastructures installed. Or you can deploy from the Azure Portal using the provided link.

## Deployed resources
Following resources will be created by the template:
- One Azure VNET with 3 subnets (1 for the NGF, additional subnets for a red and green subnet)
- Two route tables that will route all traffic for external and towards the other internal networks to the Barracuda NGF
- One external Basic Azure Load Balancer containing the deployed virtual machines with a public IP and services for IPSEC and TINA VPN tunnels available
- Two Barracuda NextGen Firewall F virtual machines with 1 network interface each and public IP
- Both NGF systems are deployed in an Availability Set

**Note** The backend subnets and resources are *not* automatically created by the template. This has to be done manually after template deployment has finished.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment you can manage them using NextGen Admin application available from Barracuda Download Portal. Management IP addresses you'll find in firewall instances properties, username is *root* and the password is what you provided during template deployment.

## Post Deployment Configuration

Visit our [campus website](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/nextgenfirewallf/doc/53248931/implementation-guide-nextgen-firewall-in-azure/) for more in-depth information on deployment and management.

It is also recommended you harden management access by enabling multifactor or key authentication and by restricting access to management interface using Management ACL: [How to Change the Root Password and Management ACL](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/cloudgenfirewall/doc/79463301/how-to-change-the-root-password-and-management-acl/)
